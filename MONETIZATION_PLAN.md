# SpecForge: Monetization Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

SpecForge aims to revolutionize the initial stages of software development by transforming raw ideas into comprehensive technical specifications using AI.

**Current Status:** SpecForge operates as a **managed freemium service**. It features Firebase-powered user authentication (Google Sign-In), cloud storage for specifications (Firestore), and metered AI usage. The application uses its own managed Gemini API key, and users are provided with a limited number of free generations per month.

**Monetization UI Implemented:** The application includes a "Billing" page visible to logged-in users. This page displays the tiered subscription model, clarifying the limits of the current free plan and outlining the upcoming paid tiers.

## 2. Target Audience & Value Proposition

### 2.1. Target Audience:
*   **Startup Founders & Solopreneurs:** Rapidly document their vision.
*   **Indie Hackers & Developers:** Quickly generate boilerplate documentation.
*   **Product Managers & Business Analysts:** Streamline creating PRDs and technical briefs.
*   **Students & Educators:** A tool for learning about spec generation and AI capabilities.

### 2.2. Core Value Proposition:
*   **Speed & Efficiency:** Dramatically reduce time writing initial technical documentation.
*   **Structure & Clarity:** Transform unstructured ideas into well-organized specifications.
*   **Interactive Refinement:** Powerful tools to "Analyze," "Elaborate On," and "Regenerate" sections of the specification.
*   **Cloud Persistence:** Users can sign in to save and manage their specs in the cloud, accessible across devices.
*   **Zero-Setup AI:** No need for users to acquire or manage their own API keys. The service is ready to use immediately after login.

## 3. Tiered Subscription Model (Freemium)

SpecForge now operates on a freemium model where the application manages the API keys and meters usage. All users start on the "Spark" plan. The paid plans introduce advanced features and higher usage limits to cater to professional and team needs.

### 3.1. Current Plan: "Spark" (Free)
*   **Price:** $0/month
*   **Target:** Individuals exploring ideas, students, and anyone wanting to try the service.
*   **Features:**
    *   **3 AI generations per month.**
    *   Full generation of all documentation modules.
    *   Interactive refinement tools ("Elaborate", "Regenerate").
    *   Saving, loading, and deleting specifications to/from the cloud (Firestore).
    *   Community Support.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Strict monthly limit on AI generations.
    *   No AI-Powered Spec Analysis.
    *   No team features or version history.

### 3.2. Future Paid Tier: "Pro"
*   **Price:** $19/month (illustrative)
*   **Target:** Startup founders, solopreneurs, freelance developers, and power users.
*   **Potential Features:**
    *   **40 AI generations per month.**
    *   All features from the Spark plan.
    *   **AI-Powered Spec Analysis** to identify gaps and suggest improvements.
    *   Priority email support.
    *   Early access to new features and models in beta.

### 3.3. Future Team Tier: "Team"
*   **Price:** $49/month (illustrative)
*   **Target:** Product Managers, small agencies, and development teams.
*   **Potential Features:**
    *   **150 AI generations per month.**
    *   All features from the Pro plan.
    *   **Team Collaboration (3 seats included)** to share and manage specs.
    *   **Specification Version History & Rollback** for cloud-saved specs.
    *   Option to remove SpecForge branding from exports.
    *   Dedicated support channel.

### 3.4. Future Agency/Enterprise Tier: "Blueprint"
*   **Price:** Custom
*   **Target:** Larger development agencies, enterprises.
*   **Potential Features:**
    *   Highest/unlimited generation quotas.
    *   Full team management & RBAC.
    *   Custom branding/white-labeling.
    *   API access for integration.
    *   Dedicated support.

## 4. Key Considerations

*   **Cost Management:** Controlling AI usage costs per user is the most critical financial aspect of running the service. The current free tier limit is designed to allow exploration without incurring significant costs.
*   **Backend Implementation:** The current usage metering is implemented using Firestore. For a production-ready paid service, this logic would be hardened, likely within a secure backend service (e.g., Firebase Functions) that also manages payment gateway integrations.
*   **Payment Gateway:** Integration with a service like Stripe will be necessary to launch the paid tiers.
*   **Security:** Firestore Security Rules are crucial to ensure users can only access their own data (`specs` and `userProfiles` collections).

## 5. Conclusion

SpecForge has successfully transitioned from a "bring your own key" tool to a managed freemium service. The core infrastructure for user accounts, cloud storage, and usage metering is in place. The next critical phase of development is to build the secure backend and payment gateway integration required to launch the paid subscription tiers.
